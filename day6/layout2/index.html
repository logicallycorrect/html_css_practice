					Using the positioning value of fixed works just like that of absolute, however the positioning is relative to the browser <a href="#"> viewport, and it</a> does not scroll with the page.That said, elementswill always be present no matter where a user stands on a page. The only caveat with fixed positioning is that it doesn’t work with Internet Explorer 6. Should you want to force fixed positioning within Internet Explorer 6 there are suitable hacks.
					Using multiple box offset properties with fixed positioning will produce the same behaviors as an absolutely positioned element.
